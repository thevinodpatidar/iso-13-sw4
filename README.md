# Cryptoctor
An electronic health record system, built on blockchain. Transparent. Secure. Immutable.



## The Problem
National health professionals operate various healthcare services at different locations. Usually, a user visits more than one health professional, eg, general practitioner, specialists, clinics, pharmacies, etc, for different needs. A scenario in the current healthcare systems, where records issued by a health provider are stored locally in the provider's data system. The provider handles all the management and maintenance of the data, most of which are database-related tasks. Example tasks include SQL reporting, database backup, system recovery, etc. It is not uncommon to utilize the storage server solutions, and some of the providers have to take the physical data storage into consideration also. Only this provider has the edit right to the records. Provided with access rights to the databases, users can query their records from different providers. Providers can also query records of a common user from other providers when they need, eg, consulting related records for making a diagnosis. Due to the lack of a standardized integration of the system, management of the entire health system is so far a significant challenge. The demand for multiple access from users and health providers have also raised the issues of security, interoperability, and privacy of the data.

## In Development Stage
